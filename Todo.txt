- Pass arrays of points through NN all at once in loss functions. This is what
the linear and activation functions actually expect (check online).

- Move Setup file outside of Code directory.

- Add optimizer, activation function options to setup file

- Implement rational functions as an option (I'll need to pass the parameters
for each layer's activation function to the optimizer). Initialize them to the
best approximation to RELU.

- Extraction mode.

- Look into eliminating the computation of du/dt for higher derivatives in
PDE residual. This may slightly improve runtime.

- Try randomizing the collocation points every few Epochs (or maybe even every
Epoch).

- Write a readme.
