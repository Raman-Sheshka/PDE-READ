- Pass arrays of points through NN all at once. This is what the linear and
activation functions actually expect (check online).

- Review comments in NN class.

- Add optimizer, activation function options to setup file

- Implement rational functions as an option (I'll need to pass the parameters
for each layer's activation function to the optimizer). Initialize them to the
best approximation to RELU.

- Try randomizing the collocation points every few Epochs (or maybe even every
Epoch).

- Write a readme.
