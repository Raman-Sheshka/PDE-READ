- Profile code

- Write a readme.

- Variable number of spatial variables for the domain (and hardcode the data
loader for the particular problem.... I guess?). I think I should hardcode cases
for 1, 2, and 3 spatial dimensions (dealing with mixed partials in extraction
mode would be tricky otherwise)

- Look into eliminating the computation of du/dt for higher derivatives in
PDE residual. This may slightly improve runtime.

- Try randomizing the collocation points every few Epochs (or maybe even every
Epoch).
