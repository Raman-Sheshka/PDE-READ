- Ability to control number of testing, training collocation points (also set
random coordinates for these).

- Extraction mode.

- Profile, optimize plotter (it's a big runtime bottleneck now)

- Variable number of spatial variables for the domain (and hardcode the data
loader for the particular problem.... I guess?). I think I should hardcode cases
for 1, 2, and 3 spatial dimensions (dealing with mixed partials in extraction
mode would be tricky otherwise)

- Add optimizer, activation function options to setup file

- Implement rational functions as an option (I'll need to pass the parameters
for each layer's activation function to the optimizer). Initialize them to the
best approximation to RELU.

- Look into eliminating the computation of du/dt for higher derivatives in
PDE residual. This may slightly improve runtime.

- Try randomizing the collocation points every few Epochs (or maybe even every
Epoch).

- Write a readme.
