# This file controls the program settings. The file consists of comment
# (lines that begin with '#') and setting lines. Each setting line consists of
# a setting name, a data type, and a value. They use the following format:
#         <Setting Name> [<data type>] : <value>
# <value>'s data type must match <data type>. You can place any number of spaces
# between the colon and <value> (the spacing doesn't matter, so long as
# the setting is all on one line). Nothing can appear after <value> on a setting
# line. You CAN NOT reorder the setting lines.
#
# The reader will ignore all blank lines, as well as any comment lines. Feel
# free to add in blank lines/comments as you see fit, as they will not break the
# reader.

# Save, Load, Plot Settings
# If you plan to load the state of either network, then the network
# Architecture settings must match those of the saved network. (same number of
# layers and neurons per layer).
#
# The current value of the "Floating Point Precision" setting does not need to
# match that of the saved state. Thus, you will be fine if the save used single
# and you want to switch to doubles.
#
# If you Load the Optimizer state, then the Optimizer setting must match
# that of the saved optimizer. (If the save used Adam, then you must use Adam
# here as well).
#
# The Load/Save File Name, as well as the Data File Name can not contain spaces
# The Data File Name should include the file's file extension.
#
# You CAN NOT load the optimizer state if you change from Discovery mode to
# PINNs mode or vice versa. Further, you CAN NOT load the optimizer state in
# extraction mode (it will throw an error).

# Mode
# The "PINNs, Discovery, or Extraction mode" controls what the code does. The
allowed values for this setting are "PINNs", "Discovery", and "Extraction".
# Actually, the parser will interpret any word that begins with "p" or "P" as
# "PINNs", any word that begins with "d" or "D" as "Discovery", and any word
# that begins with "e" or "E" as "Extraction"... PDE's, get it? ;)
#
# In Discovery mode, we learn both the Solution and PDE networks. The loss comes
# from the data and collocation losses. In this mode, you can ignore the PINNs
# and Extraction settings, as the parser will ignore them.
#
# In PINNs mode, we only learn the solution network (not the PDE network, which
# means that you should load a trained PDE network). The loss comes from the
# collocation points, the IC, and the periodic BCs. In this mode, you MUST set
# the "Periodic BCs highest order". If this setting is set to N, then we will
# enforce periodic BCs on the solution and its first N-1 derivatives.
#
# In Extraction mode, neither network learns. Instead, we attempt to
# extract a PDE from the solution network (which probably means that you should
# load a trained solution network). In this mode, you must set the "Extracted
# PDE term degree" and "Number of Extraction Points" settings. The former
# controls the maximum degree of the terms that we try to extract (the term
# du_dx has degree one, u*du_dx has degree 2, u^2 (du_dx)^3 d^2u_dx^2 has order
# 6, etc.). The latter controls the number of points (in the PDE domain) at
# which we attempt to extract the PDE.
