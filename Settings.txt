# This file controls the program settings. The file consists of blank, comment,
# and setting lines. Each comment line begins with '#'. Each setting line uses
# the following format:
#         <Setting Name> [<data type>] : <value>
# <value>'s data type must match <data type>. You can place any number of spaces
# between the colon and <value> (the spacing after the colon doesn't matter, so
# long as the setting is all on one line). Nothing can appear after <value> on a
# setting line. You CAN NOT change the order of the setting lines.
#
# The reader will ignore all blank and comment lines. Thus, you can add them as
# you see fit, as they will not break the reader.

# Save, Load Settings
# The "Floating Point Precision" setting does not need to match that of the
# saved state. Thus, for example, you can load a save that used singles into a
# network that uses doubles.
#
# The Load/Save File Name, and the Data File Name can not contain spaces. The
# Data File Name should include a file extension.
#
# The code will NOT load the Optimizer if in Extraction mode. In this case, the
# Reader ignores the load optimizer setting.

# Mode
# The "PINNs, Discovery, or Extraction mode" setting controls what the code
# does. The allowed values for this setting are "PINNs", "Discovery", and
# "Extraction". Actually, the reader will interpret any word that begins with
# "p" or "P" as "PINNs", any word that begins with "d" or "D" as "Discovery",
# and any word that begins with "e" or "E" as "Extraction"... PDE's, get it? ;)
#
# In Discovery mode, the code trains both the Solution and PDE networks. The
# loss consists of data and collocation losses. In this mode, the reader will
# ignore the PINNs and Extraction settings (so you can too!)
#
# In PINNs mode, the code trains the solution network (not the PDE network,
# which means that you should load a trained PDE network). The loss comes from
# the collocation points, the IC, and the periodic BCs. In this mode, you MUST
# set the "Periodic BCs highest order" setting. If this setting is N, we will
# enforce periodic BCs on the solution and its first N-1 derivatives.
#
# In Extraction mode, the code trains neither network. Instead, it attempts to
# extract a PDE from the PDE network (which means you should load a trained
# PDE network). In this mode, you must set the "Extracted PDE term degree" and
# "Number of Extraction Points" settings. The former controls the maximum degree
# of the terms that we try to extract (the term du_dx has degree one, u*du_dx
# has degree 2, u^2 (du_dx)^3 d^2u_dx^2 has order 6, etc.). The latter controls
# the number of points (in the PDE domain) at which we attempt to fit the PDE.
