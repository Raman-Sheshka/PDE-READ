# Instructions:
# This file controls the setup of the program. The file consists of comment
# (lines that begin with '#') and setting lines. Each setting line consists of
# a setting name, a data type, and a value. They use the following format:
#         <Setting Name> [<data type>] : <value>
# <value>'s data type must match <data type>. You can place any number of spaces
# between the colon and <value> (the spacing doesn't matter, so long as
# the setting is all on one line). Nothing can appear after <value> on a setting
# line. You CAN NOT reorder the setting lines.
#
# The reader will ignore all blank lines, as well as any comment lines. Feel
# free to add in blank lines/comments as you see fit, as they will not break the
# reader.

# General Settings
# If you plan to load the state of either network, then the network
# Architecture settings must match those of the saved network. (same number of
# layers and nodes per layer). Further, if we Load the Optimizer state, then
# Learning Rate hyper-parameters will be ignored.
#
# The Load/Save File Name, as well as the Data File Name can not contain spaces
# The Data File Name should include the file's file extension.
#
# You CAN NOT load the optimizer state if you change whether or not the N
# Network learns. If you plan to load the optimizer state from file and
# the N network had learning enabled when you saved, then you must have learning
# enabled for the N Network here too (otherwise the code WILL break).
