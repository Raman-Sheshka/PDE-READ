# This file controls the setup of the program. The file consists of comment
# (lines that begin with '#') and setting lines. Each setting line consists of
# a setting name, a data type, and a value. They use the following format:
#         <Setting Name> [<data type>] : <value>
# <value>'s data type must match <data type>. You can place any number of spaces
# between the colon and <value> (the spacing doesn't matter, so long as
# the setting is all on one line). Nothing can appear after <value> on a setting
# line. You CAN NOT reorder the setting lines.
#
# The reader will ignore all blank lines, as well as any comment lines. Feel
# free to add in blank lines/comments as you see fit, as they will not break the
# reader.

# General Settings
# If you plan to load the state of either network, then the network
# Architecture settings must match those of the saved network. (same number of
# layers and neurons per layer). Further, if we Load the Optimizer state, then
# Learning Rate hyper-parameters will be ignored.
#
# The Load/Save File Name, as well as the Data File Name can not contain spaces
# The Data File Name should include the file's file extension.
#
# You CAN NOT load the optimizer state if you change modes (Discovery vs PINNs).
# If you plan to load the optimizer state from file and you were in Discovery
# mode when you saved, then you must be in discovery mode now.

# PINNS or PDE Discovery mode
# The "Discovery or PINNs" setting if the code attempts to learn the PDE or
# learn a solution from a learned PDE. The allowed values for this setting are
# "PINNs" and "Discovery". Actually, the parser will interpret any word that
# begins with "p" or "P" as "PINNs", and any word that begins with "d" or "D"
# as "Discovery".
#
# If we are in Discovery mode, then the N Network will have learning enabled.
# The loss will come from the data and collocation losses. In this case, you can
# ignore the "Periodic BCs Highest Order setting", as the parser will ignore it.
#
# If we are in PINNs mode, then the N Network will not learn (which probably
# means that you should be loading a network from file). The loss will
# come from the collocation points, the IC, and the periodic BCs. In this case,
# you MUST set the "Periodic BCs highest order". If this setting is set to N,
# then we will enforce periodic BCs on the solution and its first N-1
# derivatives.
